        <h1>I am</h1>
        <p>I am unique and irreplaceable <br>
            I wonder what my future with hold <br>
            I hear static <br>
            I see what is needed to been seen <br>
            I want to isolate myself to my needs and not my wants <br>
            I am unique and irreplaceable <br> <br>

            I understand that people treat others like convenient stores <br>
            I say what people want to hear to minimilize conversations <br>
            I dream about all the falsified relationships I try to upkeep <br>
            I try to keep people at arm's length <br>
            I hope to utilize my associations with others to my benefit <br>
            I am unique and irreplaceable
